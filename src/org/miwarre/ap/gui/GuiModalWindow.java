/**
 * A class implementing the concept of a modal window, i.e. of a window with
 * which the player can interact through the mouse, suspending interaction with
 * Rising World environment. Each modal window is made of a top title bar, with
 * title and close button, and a main panel underneath where controls can be added.
 * 
 * <p>This class is not aimed at being used as it is; it is the base class of
 * several, more specialised, classes which should be used instead. It can also
 * be sub-classed, to implement specific structures or behaviours.
 * The main panel is one of the GuiGroup subclasses, with its specific arrangement
 * of children, according to the layoutType of the constructor. To the panel,
 * standard GuiElement's can be added with addChild() and addTextItem().
 * <p>GuiModalWindow manages its own event Listener; it also turns the mouse
 * cursor on on display and off on hiding.
 * <p>GuiModalWindow manages the close button in the title bar, hiding the box
 * from the player screen, freeing its resources and turning off the mouse cursor.
 * The callback object is notified of a close event by passing an id parameter
 * with a value of GuiDefs.ABORT_ID.
 * <p>The consumer plug-in needs not to do any additional management of the
 * window itself in response to this notification (of course, it should do any
 * management of its own resources).
 * <p>GuiModalWindow notifies of click and text entry events via an
 * GuiCallback object passed to the constructor or set after construction with
 * the setCallback() method.
 * <p>On events, the onCall() method of the callback object is called with
 * parameters for the player originating the event, the id of the GuiElement
 * and any additional data set for the GuiElement. Id and data for each child
 * are set when the child is added.
 * <p>This class implements a 'display stack' of modal windows: 'pushing' a new
 * window with the push() method displays the new window and 'popping' it,
 * with the pop() method, restores the window previously displayed.
